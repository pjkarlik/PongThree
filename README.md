# Pong in THREEjs

  I'm making 3D PONG type game from scratch, so lets see how this goes! Working experiment using ThreeJS to create some visual effects with GLSL fragment shaders. Working on a few variations. These can be changed in the top of the ```pong.js``` file. 

  Recently updated - press the ```space bar``` to launch the ball. Once out of bounds it resets to your paddel.
##

## TBD More to come

  The entry point is ```index.js``` --> ```./cartridge/pong.js``` which is an example of a class Render, which is attached

## Run the example
  Requires Node and Yarn to be installed for build and development.

  *Open a terminal window and type the following for local webpack dev server...*
  ```javascript
  $ yarn install /* install packages */

  $ yarn dev /* Start up local dev server */
  ```
  open http://localhost:2020
